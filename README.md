# Smush Info (sharlot fork)

A Skyline plugin that hosts a TCP server for subscribing to information about the current Smash Ultimate match. Useful for statistics, game integration, and more.

I have tacked a whole bunch of stuf onto this for [ssbu-stream-automation](https://github.com/sticks-stuff/ssbu-stream-automation). Not my best code but it works.

Seems jam1garner has left the scene so I don't feel particularly comfortable asking them licensing questions, but consider everything I've added to this project GPLv3
