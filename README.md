# Smush Info (sharlot fork)

A Skyline plugin that hosts a TCP server for subscribing to information about the current Smash Ultimate match. Useful for statistics, game integration, and more.

I have tacked a whole bunch of stuff onto this for [ssbu-stream-automation](https://github.com/sticks-stuff/ssbu-stream-automation). Not my best code but it works.

Seems jam1garner has left the scene so I don't feel particularly comfortable asking them licensing questions, but consider everything I've added to this project GPLv3

# Requirements
smush_info requires you to have the following Skyline plugins downloaded and installed:
- [Arcropolis](https://github.com/Raytwo/ARCropolis/releases)
- [libacmd_hook](https://github.com/ultimate-research/acmd_hook/releases)
- [libnn_hid_hook](https://github.com/jugeeya/nn-hid-hook/releases/tag/beta)
- [libnro_hook](https://github.com/ultimate-research/nro-hook-plugin/releases)
- [Smashline V1](https://github.com/blu-dev/smashline_hook/releases)

# How to Build and Install
You must have Rust and Cargo installed. [Click here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for instructions on how to install based on your system.

Once those are installed, open your command prompt or terminal and run the following commands
```sh
cargo install cargo-skyline
```

To compile your plugin use the following command in the root of the project (beside the `Cargo.toml` file):
```sh
cargo skyline build
```
Your resulting plugin will be the `.nro` found in the folder
```
[plugin name]/target/aarch64-skyline-switch
```
To install (you must already have skyline installed on your switch), put the plugin on your SD at:
```
sd:/atmosphere/contents/01006A800016E000/romfs/skyline/plugins
```

`cargo skyline` can also automate some of this process via FTP. If you have an FTP client on your Switch, you can run:
```sh
cargo skyline set-ip [Switch IP]
# install to the correct plugin folder on the Switch and listen for logs
cargo skyline run 
```
